# Pitch_Detection
A Real-Time System Which Detects The Pitch(The Note) Of The Input Sound
In This Project A Pitch Detection Algorithm Is Used To Determine The Note Of The Input Sound.
Simulation Environment Is Proteus, And Keil Î¼Vision IDE Is Used.Both Files Are Provided.
A Table Of Notes With Their Frequencies Can Be Found Here : https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html
And A Downloadable Version Of Each Frequency Can Be Generated Online In Websites Like : https://onlinetonegenerator.com/.
